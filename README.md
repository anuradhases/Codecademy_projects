# Codecademy_projects
Here I have showcased some of the projects I worked on while completing the courses: Learn Python 3, and Data Scientist: Machine Learning.

All projects were done with Jupyter notebook. Projects cover the following concepts in Python: functions, loops, data manipulation with pandas, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, and string manipulation.
